# Game of Life

## Overview
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans.

## Description
This Python program implements a basic version of the Game of Life. It uses a grid of cells, where each cell can be alive (1) or dead (0). The program simulates multiple generations based on the rules of the Game of Life, creating an animation of the evolving grid.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python game_of_life.py
    ```
5. Adjust the grid size, number of generations, and delay in the script as needed.

## Configuration
You can customize the simulation by modifying the following parameters in the script:
- `rows`: Number of rows in the grid.
- `cols`: Number of columns in the grid.
- `generations`: Number of generations to simulate.
- `delay`: Time delay between each generation (in seconds).

## Dependencies
This program has no external dependencies. It uses only the standard Python library.
